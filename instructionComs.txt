VCRTS: Vehicular Cloud Real Time System
Project Milestone 4: Class Implementation
Due Sunday, Mar 23rd at 11:59pm

Complete the following tasks for the classes that you have designed in the previous phase. I have
made a sample project called ATM available on Canvas that you can use as an example.


Implementation
• Simply write a Java source file for each class (instance variable, methods). Start with
implementing the classes that don’t depend on others
Implement the classes on top of your GUI. Your implementation should be able to run the
following scenario:

Client can submit a job to VC and the information will be stored in a file.
Vehicle Owner can register in the system and the information will be stored in a file.
VC Controller will be able to compute the completion time for each job.
How to calculate the completion time of a job?

System keeps track of all the jobs based on their arrival time. Use FIFO algorithm to calculate
the completion time. For example, if you have 3 jobs in the system with following arrival order:

ID: 345, 56, 690
Duration: 5, 2, 9


The completion time for the jobs are
5, 7, 16
Note: There should be a button on the GUI that calculates the completion time
